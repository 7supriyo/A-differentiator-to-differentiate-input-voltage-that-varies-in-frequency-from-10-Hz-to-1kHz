# A-differentiator-to-differentiate-input-voltage-that-varies-in-frequency-from-10-Hz-to-1kHz

The project involves designing and building an operational amplifier-based differentiator circuit. The purpose of this circuit is to differentiate an input voltage signal that varies in frequency from 10 Hz to 1 kHz.The differentiator circuit is designed using an op-amp, two resistors, and two capacitors. The values of these components are calculated based on the desired frequency range. The circuit is then physically built on a breadboard and tested with an input signal within the specified frequency range.
